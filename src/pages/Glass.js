              The Legend features our new ColorBoost Lenses. With 2 years of
              development, the Cassette ColorBoost Lenses attenuate certain
              wavelengths of light to equalize, enhance, brighten and give
              contrast to colors while reducing overall light to a comfortable
              level. Better color contrast & recognition gives you more visual
              sensitivity and clarity. Cassette ColorBoost, Superior Color,
